# Validation Plan: Test Before Building

**Last Updated**: October 15, 2025
**Goal**: Validate product-market fit BEFORE investing 160 hours of development

---

## üéØ Why Validate First?

**Problem**: You could spend 3-4 months building a SaaS nobody wants
**Solution**: Test demand with minimal investment (5-10 hours, not 160 hours)

**The Validation Question**:
> "Will traders pay $29/month for AI-powered daily trading signals?"

**How to Answer**: Talk to 20-30 potential customers, get commitments

---

## üìã Option C: Validation Strategy (This Week)

### Step 1: Test Current Email (Day 1-2)

**Action**: Send current digest email to potential users

**Who to Send To** (Target: 20 people):
- [ ] 5 friends/family who trade stocks
- [ ] 5 traders from Reddit (DM them: "Building tool, want free access?")
- [ ] 5 traders from Discord servers
- [ ] 5 from Twitter (finance/trading accounts)

**Email Template for Outreach**:
```
Subject: Free Trading Signals - Want Early Access?

Hey [Name],

I'm building an AI-powered trading signal platform that delivers actionable
trade ideas every morning before market open.

Current version sends daily email digest with:
‚Ä¢ Top bullish/bearish signals with confidence scores
‚Ä¢ Why each signal matters (fundamental + technical analysis)
‚Ä¢ How to trade it (entry, stop-loss, target)
‚Ä¢ Market snapshot (VIX, SPY, indices)

Would you be interested in free early access? Just reply with your email
and I'll add you to the list.

Also - honest question: Would you pay $29/month for this if the signals
were consistently good?

Thanks,
Jason
```

**How to Send**:
```bash
# Option A: Manually add emails to digest
# Edit backend/scripts/send_daily_digest.py, add multiple recipients

# Option B: Create a test distribution list
export TEST_EMAILS="friend1@email.com,friend2@email.com,friend3@email.com"

# Send test email
cd backend
python scripts/send_daily_digest.py --email $TEST_EMAILS
```

**Track Responses**:
Create a simple spreadsheet:
```
| Name | Source | Opened? | Replied? | Would Pay? | Feedback |
|------|--------|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| John | Reddit | Yes | Yes | Maybe | "Need real data not demo" |
| Sarah | Friend | Yes | Yes | Yes! | "Love the format" |
| Mike | Discord| No | No | - | - |
```

### Step 2: Survey Questions (Day 3-4)

After they receive 2-3 emails, send follow-up survey:

**Survey (Google Forms - Free)**:
```
# Market Intelligence Platform - Feedback Survey

1. Have you been receiving our daily trading signals?
   [ ] Yes [ ] No

2. Do you open the emails?
   [ ] Every day [ ] Sometimes [ ] Rarely [ ] Never

3. Have you followed any of the trade ideas?
   [ ] Yes, multiple [ ] Yes, one or two [ ] No, not yet [ ] No, won't

4. Rate the signal quality (1-5):
   [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]

5. What would make the signals more useful?
   [Open text field]

6. Would you pay $29/month for this if signals improved?
   [ ] Definitely yes
   [ ] Probably yes
   [ ] Maybe
   [ ] Probably no
   [ ] Definitely no

7. If not $29, what's the right price?
   [ ] $9/month
   [ ] $19/month
   [ ] $29/month
   [ ] $49/month
   [ ] $99/month
   [ ] I wouldn't pay for this

8. What's the #1 feature you'd want added?
   [Open text field]

9. Can we follow up with you for a 15-min interview?
   [ ] Yes - [email/phone]
   [ ] No thanks
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ **Go**: ‚â•50% say "Definitely yes" or "Probably yes" to paying $29/month
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Maybe**: 30-50% positive ‚Üí Test lower price point ($19/month)
- ‚ùå **No-Go**: <30% positive ‚Üí Pivot or abandon

---

### Step 3: Customer Interviews (Day 5-7)

**Goal**: Deep dive with 5-10 interested users

**Interview Questions** (15 minutes):
1. "Tell me about your current trading routine"
2. "What tools do you use for trade ideas?" (FinViz, Seeking Alpha, etc.)
3. "What frustrates you about those tools?"
4. "What did you think of our daily email?"
5. "What would make you pay for trading signals?"
6. "Have you ever paid for trading tools/services? Which ones?"
7. "Would $29/month be a no-brainer, expensive, or about right?"
8. "If we added [feature X], would that increase your willingness to pay?"

**Take Notes**:
- Record interviews (with permission) or take detailed notes
- Look for patterns in feedback
- Identify must-have features vs. nice-to-haves

---

### Step 4: Validate Willingness to Pay (Day 8-10)

**The Ultimate Test**: Pre-sales

**Action**: Create a simple landing page that says:

```html
# Daily Trading Signals - Launching Soon

AI-powered trade ideas delivered every morning.

Current signals are demo data. Launching with real-time signals in 60 days.

Early bird pricing: $19/month (regular $29/month)

[Sign Up for Early Access - $19/month]
   ‚Üì
Stripe checkout (charges card immediately)

"Access begins in 60 days. Cancel anytime for full refund."
```

**Why This Works**:
- If people actually PAY, you've validated demand
- If they don't pay, you save 160 hours of building
- Money > survey responses (people lie on surveys, money doesn't lie)

**Goal**: Get 10 pre-sales ($190 revenue) before building anything

**Tools Needed**:
- Landing page: Carrd.co (free) or HTML page hosted on GitHub Pages
- Payments: Stripe checkout link
- Time to build: 2-3 hours

**Example Landing Page Copy**:
```

## üéØ Validation Questions & Answers

### Q1: "What if I can't find 20 test users?"
**Answer**: Start smaller
- 5 users is enough for directional feedback
- Quality > quantity for early validation
- Even 1 paying customer proves someone values it

### Q2: "The demo signals are fake, won't users hate that?"
**Answer**: Be transparent
- Say upfront: "Currently demo data, launching with real signals in 60 days"
- Users care more about FORMAT than current accuracy
- Use demo to test: layout, delivery time, explanation quality

### Q3: "What if validation fails (no one wants to pay)?"
**Answer**: Pivot or kill the project EARLY
- Better to fail in 10 days than after 160 hours of coding
- Possible pivots:
  - Different pricing ($9/month instead of $29)
  - Different audience (crypto traders instead of stock traders)
  - Different format (Discord bot instead of email)
  - Add different value (education/courses instead of just signals)

### Q4: "I don't have time for 14 hours of validation"
**Answer**: Do mini-validation (5 hours)
- Skip landing page and pre-sales
- Just send email to 5 friends, ask: "Would you pay for this?"
- Do 3 customer interviews (1 hour each)
- Use gut feel + feedback to decide
- Risk: Less confidence, but faster

### Q5: "What if validation is strong? Do I commit to 160 hours?"
**Answer**: Yes, but build in checkpoints
- After Month 1 (real data): Re-validate with test users
- After Month 2 (dashboard): Get 5 beta testers
- After Month 3 (MVP launch): Aim for 10 paying customers in first month
- If any checkpoint fails, pause and reassess

   - Confirmed pricing ($29 or adjust)
   - Feature priorities

2. **Revise Roadmap** (1 hour)

   - Set up local development
   - Schedule coding blocks
   - Proceed to Month 1, Week 1

### If Validation Fails (No-Go Decision)
1. **Analyze Why** (1 hour)
   - Was pricing too high?
   - Is the format wrong (email vs. dashboard)?
   - Is the audience wrong (stock traders vs. crypto)?
   - Are trading signals the wrong product (vs. education)?

2. **Consider Pivots** (2 hours)
   - Pivot 1: Lower pricing ($9/month, target 110 users for $1K MRR)
   - Pivot 2: Different format (Discord bot, Telegram channel)
   - Pivot 3: Different audience (crypto, forex, options)
   - Pivot 4: Different product (trading education, not signals)

3. **Re-Validate or Stop** (Your choice)
   - If pivot seems promising, run another 10-day validation
   - If no clear path, stop project (save 160 hours)
   - Document learnings for future projects
