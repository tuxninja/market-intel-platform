## ü§î Strategic Questions to Consider

### Question 1: Target Audience

**Who are we building this for?**

Option A: **Retail Day Traders**
- Trade daily/multiple times per week
- Use TradingView, FinViz, Discord communities
- Income: $50k-150k/year
- Age: 25-45
- Willing to pay: $29-49/month
- **Pros**: Large market, easier to reach via Reddit/Twitter
- **Cons**: Price-sensitive, high churn risk

Option B: **Active Swing Traders**
- Hold positions 2-7 days
- More research-focused, less impulsive
- Income: $75k-200k/year
- Age: 30-50
- Willing to pay: $49-99/month
- **Pros**: Higher willingness to pay, lower churn

### Question 2: Pricing Strategy

**What should we charge?**

| Tier | Monthly | Annual | Target Users | Conversion Goal |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Low** | $9 | $90 ($7.50/mo) | 110 users for $1K MRR | Easier conversions, lower churn |
| **Medium** | $29 | $290 ($24/mo) | 35 users for $1K MRR | Sweet spot for retail traders |
| **High** | $49 | $490 ($41/mo) | 21 users for $1K MRR | Premium positioning, higher value perception |

**My Recommendation**: $29/month with annual discount
- **Rationale**:
  - Not too cheap (signals are "free")
  - Not too expensive (barrier to entry)
  - Industry standard: FinViz Elite ($40), Seeking Alpha Pro ($29)
  - 35 paying customers is achievable in 6 months

**Discount Strategy**:
- Launch special: $19/month for first 50 customers (grandfather pricing)
- Annual discount: $290/year ($24/month, saves $58)
- Black Friday: 40% off ($17/month annual)

**Your Decision**:
- [ ] $9/month (need 110 customers)
- [ ] $19/month (need 53 customers)
- [ ] $29/month (need 35 customers) ‚Üê Recommended
- [ ] $49/month (need 21 customers)
- [ ] Other: $______/month

### Question 3: Free Tier vs. Free Trial

**How should we handle free users?**

Option A: **Freemium Model** (Free tier forever)
- Free users get 5 signals/day (top-rated only), email delivery only
- Pro users get unlimited signals, dashboard, watchlist
- **Pros**: Build large free user base, some convert to paid
- **Cons**: Free users consume resources, may never convert

Option B: **14-Day Free Trial** (No free tier)
- All users start with 14-day Pro trial
- After 14 days: pay $29/month or lose access
- **Pros**: Forces conversion decision, higher revenue per user
- **Cons**: Smaller user base, higher barrier to entry

Option C: **Hybrid** (Free tier + trial upgrade)
- Free tier: 5 signals/day, email only (forever)
- Pro trial: 14-day trial of unlimited signals + dashboard
- After trial: downgrade to free or pay
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds
- **Cons**: More complex to implement

**My Recommendation**: **Option C (Hybrid)**
- **Rationale**:
  - Free tier for top-of-funnel growth
  - Trial converts interested users
  - Users don't lose everything if they can't pay
- **Implementation**: Free tier for Month 1, add trial in Month 3

**Your Decision**:
- [ ] Option A: Freemium (free tier forever)
- [ ] Option B: 14-day trial only
- [ ] Option C: Hybrid (recommended)
- [ ] Other: __________

### Question 6: Marketing Strategy

**How will you get your first 100 users?**

Select your primary channel (focus on 1, max 2):

**Option A: Reddit** (Organic, free)
- Post valuable content in r/StockMarket, r/algotrading, r/Daytrading
- DM active traders offering free access
- **Time**: 3-5 hrs/week

### Question 7: Tech Stack Concerns

**Any reservations about the recommended tech stack?**

**Current Plan**:
- Backend: Python + FastAPI (already built ‚úÖ)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (new)
- Database: PostgreSQL / Supabase (already set up ‚úÖ)
- Hosting: AWS ECS Fargate (backend) + Amplify (frontend)
- Payments: Stripe

**Alternative Considerations**:

**Frontend Alternatives**:
- Vue.js (simpler learning curve, smaller ecosystem)
- Next.js (React framework, better SEO, more opinionated)
- Svelte (fastest, smallest bundle, newer)

**Backend Alternatives**:
- Keep Python (recommended) ‚úÖ
- Node.js + Express (JavaScript full-stack, bigger ecosystem)
- Django (Python framework, more batteries-included, heavier)

**Hosting Alternatives**:
- Current: AWS (ECS + Amplify) ‚Üê Recommended
- Heroku (simpler, more expensive at scale)
- Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend) (easier setup, similar cost)
- DigitalOcean App Platform (middle ground)

**My Recommendation**: **Stick with current plan**
- Python backend already works
- React is industry standard (easy to hire later)
- AWS is cheapest at scale
- Don't context-switch tech unnecessarily

**Your Decision**:
- [ ] Keep current tech stack (recommended)
- [ ] Change frontend to: __________
- [ ] Change hosting to: __________
- [ ] Other concerns: __________

### Question 8: Time Commitment Concerns

**Can you realistically commit 10 hours/week for 3-4 months?**

**Honest Assessment**:

Life commitments that might interfere:
- [ ] Day job requires frequent overtime
- [ ] Family obligations (young kids, etc.)
- [ ] Other side projects competing for time
- [ ] Seasonal busy periods (holidays, tax season, etc.)

**Contingency Plans**:

If 10 hrs/week isn't realistic:
- **Option A**: Reduce scope (launch with less features, e.g., no dashboard, just improve email)
- **Option B**: Extend timeline (5 hrs/week = 6-8 months to launch)
- **Option C**: Hire contractor for frontend ($3k-5k), you focus on backend
- **Option D**: Pause project, revisit when time allows

**My Recommendation**:
- Be honest about available time
- It's better to commit 5 hrs/week consistently than 10 hrs/week sporadically
- Adjust timeline accordingly

**Your Decision**:
- [ ] Yes, 10 hrs/week is realistic (stick to 4-month plan)
- [ ] No, 5-7 hrs/week more realistic (extend to 6 months)
- [ ] Unsure, want to start and see how it goes
- [ ] Other: __________

### Question 9: Revenue Expectations

**What happens if you don't hit $1K MRR in 6 months?**

**Scenario Planning**:

After 6 months, you have 15 paying customers (not 35):
- Revenue: 15 √ó $29 = $435/month
- Time invested: 160 hours + 40 hours marketing = 200 hours
- Hourly rate: $435 / 10 hrs/week = $10.88/hour

**Options**:
- **A**: Keep going (6 more months to hit $1K)
- **B**: Pivot (change product, pricing, or audience)
- **C**: Shut down (cut losses, move on)
- **D**: Maintain as side project (keep at $435/month, don't invest more time)

**My Recommendation**:
- Set clear milestones: Month 3 (10 customers), Month 6 (25 customers), Month 12 (50 customers)
- If you miss Month 3 milestone badly (<5 customers), reassess
- If you miss Month 6 but have 15-20 customers, keep going (trajectory is positive)

**Your Decision**:
- [ ] I'm committed regardless of revenue (building for learning/portfolio)
- [ ] I want $1K MRR within 6 months or I'll pivot
- [ ] I want $1K MRR within 6 months or I'll shut down
- [ ] I'll decide based on early traction
- [ ] Other: __________

### Question 10: Exit Strategy

**What's the endgame?**

**Option A: Lifestyle Business**
- Grow to $5-10K MRR (150-350 customers)
- Maintain solo or with 1-2 contractors
- Keep as passive income side business
- **Pros**: No investors, full control, passive income
- **Cons**: Limited growth, no exit opportunity

**Option B: Venture-Scale Business**
- Grow to $100K+ MRR (raise VC funding)
- Build team, aggressive growth
- Aim for acquisition or IPO
- **Pros**: High upside, resources to grow fast
- **Cons**: Loss of control, high pressure, dilution

**Option C: Strategic Acquisition**
- Grow to $10-30K MRR
- Sell to larger fintech company (E*TRADE, Robinhood, etc.)
- **Pros**: Exit liquidity, less pressure than VC route
- **Cons**: Requires product-market fit + brand recognition

**Option D: Open Source / Community**
- Make product free/open source
- Monetize via donations, consulting, or enterprise tier
- **Pros**: Build community, reputation
- **Cons**: Hard to monetize, requires different mindset

**My Recommendation**: **Start with Option A** (Lifestyle Business)
- **Rationale**:
  - Keep it simple, test product-market fit first
  - If it grows to $10K+ MRR, you can always raise funding or sell later
  - Don't optimize for exit before you have traction

**Your Decision**:
- [ ] Option A: Lifestyle business ($5-10K MRR goal)
- [ ] Option B: Venture-scale (raise funding)
- [ ] Option C: Strategic acquisition (build to sell)
- [ ] Option D: Open source
- [ ] Unsure, depends on traction

## ‚ùì Technical Questions

### Q1: "I've never built a React app before, is this realistic?"

**Answer**: Yes, but expect learning curve
- **React basics**: 10-15 hours to learn (tutorials, docs)
- **Add to timeline**: +1 week for frontend phase
- **Alternative**: Use simpler framework (Vue.js) or hire contractor for frontend

**Resources**:
- React docs: https://react.dev/learn
- React + TypeScript: https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/
- shadcn/ui components: https://ui.shadcn.com/ (pre-built)

**My Recommendation**:
- Spend 5 hours learning React basics before Month 2
- Use pre-built components (shadcn/ui) to avoid building from scratch
- Budget 40 hours for frontend (not 35) to account for learning

**Paid Resources**:
- Hire contractor on Upwork ($25-50/hr) to unblock you
- Buy course (Udemy, ~$15) if you're stuck on specific concept
- Cursor AI ($20/month) for faster coding

**My Recommendation**:
- Try to solve for 1-2 hours max
- If still stuck, ask for help (Claude Code, Reddit)
- Don't waste 20% of your weekly hours on one bug

---

### Q3: "What if Stripe integration is too complicated?"

**Answer**: Stripe is actually very easy

**Why it's easy**:
- Excellent documentation with code examples
- Test mode (use fake credit cards)

### Q4: "What if I need help with design/UX?"

**Answer**: Use pre-built components + copy competitors

**Don't design from scratch**:
- Use shadcn/ui (pre-built React components)
- Copy layout from Robinhood, TradingView, Seeking Alpha
- Keep it simple: white/dark theme, standard buttons/cards

**Resources**:
- shadcn/ui: https://ui.shadcn.com/
- Tailwind CSS: https://tailwindcss.com/docs
- Dribbble: https://dribbble.com/search/trading-dashboard (inspiration)

**Estimated time savings**: 20+ hours by not designing from scratch

### Q5: "How do I know if my code quality is good enough?"

**Answer**: MVP = working, not perfect

**Good enough for MVP**:
- ‚úÖ It works (no critical bugs)
- ‚úÖ Users can sign up, subscribe, view signals
- ‚úÖ Stripe payments process correctly
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Code is readable (but not perfectly organized)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Some technical debt (that's okay)

**Not required for MVP**:
- ‚ùå 100% test coverage
- ‚ùå Perfect code organization
- ‚ùå Optimized performance (unless it's slow)
- ‚ùå Beautiful design

**Refactor later**: After MVP launch, if you get traction, you can improve code quality
