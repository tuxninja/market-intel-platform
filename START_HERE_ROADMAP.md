## 🗺️ Your 3-Step Journey

You said you want to do: **C → B → A**
1. **C**: Validate demand first
2. **B**: Review and refine the plan
3. **A**: Execute (start coding)

Let's break down what each step means:

---

## Step C: Validate Demand (THIS WEEK)

**Goal**: Test if people will actually pay $29/month BEFORE you invest 160 hours building

### 📋 Documents to Read:
1. **VALIDATION_PLAN.md** - Your complete validation guide

### 🎯 Three Validation Options:

**Option 1: Mini Validation** (3 hours, 2 days) ← Start here
- Send current email to 5 friends who trade
- Ask: "Would you pay $29/month for better signals?"
- Get gut feel, decide whether to proceed
- **Best for**: Quick test, low time investment

**Option 2: Quick Validation** (7 hours, 5 days)
- Send email to 10 test users
- Run survey (Google Form)
- Do 3 customer interviews
- **Best for**: More confidence, moderate time

**Option 3: Full Validation** (14 hours, 10 days)
- Send email to 20 test users
- Survey + 5-10 interviews
- Create landing page with pre-sales
- **Best for**: Highest confidence before building

### ✅ Success Criteria:
- **GO**: 50%+ say they'd pay $29/month
- **MAYBE**: 30-50% (test lower price, $19/month)
- **NO-GO**: <30% (pivot or stop)

### 📝 Action Items (This Week):
- [ ] Choose validation intensity (mini/quick/full)
- [ ] Read VALIDATION_PLAN.md (30 min)
- [ ] Create list of 5-20 potential test users
- [ ] Send outreach messages
- [ ] Add emails to digest, send test email
- [ ] Collect feedback via survey or interviews

---

## Step B: Review & Refine (AFTER VALIDATION)

**Goal**: Make key strategic decisions based on validation feedback

### 📋 Documents to Read:
1. **QUESTIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md** - 10 key questions to answer
2. **STRATEGIC_REVIEW.md** - Part-time specific plan

**Decision 3: MVP Features**
- What MUST be in first launch?
- What can wait until v2?

**Decision 4: Timeline**
- [ ] 3 months (aggressive, 15 hrs/week)
- [ ] 4 months (moderate, 10 hrs/week) ← Recommended
- [ ] 6 months (conservative, 5-7 hrs/week)

**Decision 5: Marketing Channel**
- [ ] Reddit (organic, free)
- [ ] Twitter (organic, slow build)
- [ ] SEO Blog (long-term)
- [ ] Paid ads (fast but expensive)

### 📝 Action Items (After Validation):

## ❓ FAQs

### Q: "Do I really need to validate first?"
**A**: Highly recommended. 3-14 hours of validation can save you 160 hours of building something nobody wants. Many failed startups skip validation.

### Q: "What if validation fails?"
**A**: You have options:
1. Pivot (different pricing, audience, or product)
2. Improve the demo and re-validate
3. Stop and save 160 hours (better to fail in 1 week than 4 months)

### Q: "Can I skip straight to building?"
**A**: Yes, but risky. If you're building purely for learning or portfolio (not revenue), validation is less critical. But if you want $1K MRR, validate first.

### Q: "I don't have 10 hours/week, what should I do?"
**A**: Options:
1. Reduce scope (just improve email, skip dashboard)
2. Extend timeline (5 hrs/week = 6-8 months)
3. Hire contractor for frontend ($3k-5k)
4. Pause until you have more time

### Q: "What if I get stuck on something technical?"
**A**: Multiple options:
1. Ask Claude Code (me!) for help
2. Post on Reddit/StackOverflow
3. Hire contractor for $50-100 to unblock
4. Don't waste more than 2 hours stuck on one issue

### Q: "When should I quit my day job?"
**A**: **Don't quit yet!**
- Build to $5-10K MRR first (150-350 customers)
- Have 6 months runway saved
- Test that revenue is consistent (not just Month 1 spike)
- This is Year 2+ decision, not Year 1
