# Strategic Review: Part-Time Path to $1K MRR

**Last Updated**: October 15, 2025
**Your Goals**:
- ‚úÖ Build full SaaS product
- ‚úÖ Part-time development (~10 hrs/week)
- ‚úÖ Target: $1,000/month revenue

**Timeline**: 3-4 months to launch (realistic for part-time)

---

## üéØ The $1K/Month Math

To hit $1,000 MRR, you need one of these user mixes:

| Scenario | Free Users | Pro ($29) | Premium ($99) | MRR |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| **A: Pro-Heavy** | 100 | 35 | 0 | $1,015 |
| **B: Balanced** | 75 | 25 | 5 | $1,220 |
| **C: Premium-Heavy** | 50 | 15 | 8 | $1,227 |

**Most Realistic**: Scenario A - Focus on getting 35 Pro subscribers
- Pro tier is easier to sell than Premium ($29 vs $99)
- Premium features (API) require more development time
- 35 paying customers is achievable in 6 months

**Conversion Funnel**:
```
1000 website visitors
  ‚Üí 50 signups (5% conversion)
    ‚Üí 35 Pro subscribers (70% of signups)
      ‚Üí $1,015 MRR
```

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Part-Time Development Timeline

**Total Time**: 3-4 months (120-160 hours of work)

### Month 1: Real Market Data (Weeks 1-4)
**Time**: 10-15 hours
**Focus**: Replace demo signals with real data

| Week | Hours | Tasks |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | 3 hrs | Set up API keys (Alpha Vantage, NewsAPI), install dependencies |
| 2 | 4 hrs | Create market_data_service.py, fetch stock prices + technical indicators |
| 3 | 4 hrs | Create news_service.py, sentiment analysis |
| 4 | 4 hrs | Update digest_service.py, test end-to-end, deploy |

**Deliverable**: Email with real trading signals based on actual market data

**Key Decision Point**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do we need real signals before launching frontend?**
- **Recommendation**: YES - Without real data, you can't validate product-market fit
- **Rationale**: Free users will test real signals, then convert to Pro if signals work

---

### Month 2: Web Dashboard (Weeks 5-8)
**Time**: 30-40 hours
**Focus**: Basic frontend for users to view signals

| Week | Hours | Tasks |
|------|-------|-------|
| 5 | 8 hrs | Set up React app, install dependencies, create basic layout |
| 6 | 8 hrs | Build login/signup pages, implement JWT authentication |
| 7 | 10 hrs | Create dashboard page (display signals from API), market snapshot |
| 8 | 8 hrs | Deploy to AWS Amplify, test end-to-end, fix bugs |

**Deliverable**: Working web dashboard at https://marketintel.com

**Key Decision Point**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **How much polish does the MVP need?**
- **Recommendation**: Minimum viable UI - No fancy charts, no animations
- **Rationale**: Speed to market > perfection. Get feedback from real users ASAP

**MVP Features** (Must-Have):
- ‚úÖ Login/signup
- ‚úÖ View today's signals (list view)
- ‚úÖ Market snapshot (VIX, indices)
- ‚úÖ Sentiment filter (bullish/bearish/neutral)

**V2 Features** (Nice-to-Have, defer):
- ‚ùå TradingView charts
- ‚ùå Historical signal archive
- ‚ùå Mobile app
- ‚ùå Social sharing

---

### Month 3: Subscriptions (Weeks 9-12)
**Time**: 25-35 hours
**Focus**: Stripe integration, pricing tiers, feature gating

| Week | Hours | Tasks |
|------|-------|-------|
| 9 | 8 hrs | Set up Stripe account, create products (Pro/Premium), test checkout |
| 10 | 10 hrs | Backend: subscription_service.py, webhook handling, user tier tracking |
| 11 | 8 hrs | Frontend: pricing page, subscription flow, feature gating |
| 12 | 8 hrs | End-to-end testing (test cards), fix bugs, deploy |

**Deliverable**: ‚úÖ **MVP LAUNCH** - Users can sign up and pay

**Key Decision Point**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Launch with 2 tiers or 3 tiers?**
- **Recommendation**: Start with 2 tiers (Free + Pro), add Premium later
- **Rationale**: Simplify decision-making for early users, reduce dev time

**Simplified Pricing (Launch)**:
| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 5 signals/day, email only |
| **Pro** | $29/month | Unlimited signals, dashboard, custom watchlist |

**Add Later (Month 4+)**:
| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Premium** | $99/month | API access, real-time alerts, analytics |

---

### Month 4: Marketing & Iteration (Weeks 13-16)
**Time**: 15-20 hours
**Focus**: Get first paying customers, iterate on feedback

| Week | Hours | Tasks |
|------|-------|-------|
| 13 | 5 hrs | Write launch blog post, create Twitter account, post on Reddit |
| 14 | 5 hrs | Reach out to trading communities (Discord servers), offer free trials |
| 15 | 5 hrs | Collect user feedback, fix critical bugs, improve onboarding |
| 16 | 5 hrs | Add requested features (based on user feedback) |

**Goal**: 10 paying customers by end of Month 4

## üöß Part-Time Development Challenges

### Challenge 1: Context Switching
**Problem**: Hard to remember where you left off when coding 2-3 hrs at a time
**Solution**:
- Use TODO comments liberally in code
- Write daily notes: "Next session: implement X"
- Commit work-in-progress to git with descriptive messages

### Challenge 2: Long Feedback Loops
**Problem**: Deploy ‚Üí test ‚Üí iterate cycle takes days instead of hours
**Solution**:
- Test everything locally before deploying
- Use docker-compose to replicate production exactly
- Write automated tests to catch regressions

### Challenge 3: Motivation Dips
**Problem**: Hard to stay motivated over 3-4 months with slow progress
**Solution**:
- Set weekly milestones (not just monthly)
- Share progress publicly (Twitter, blog)
- Focus on one feature at a time (no scope creep)

---

## üìã Weekly Schedule Recommendation

**Assume**: 10 hours/week available

### Option A: Weeknights (Recommended for consistency)
```
Mon: OFF
Tue: 2 hours (6-8 PM)
Wed: 2 hours (6-8 PM)
Thu: OFF
Fri: OFF
Sat: 4 hours (9 AM - 1 PM)
Sun: 2 hours (9-11 AM)

Total: 10 hours/week
```

**Pros**: Regular cadence, easier to build habit
**Cons**: Weeknight fatigue after day job

### Option B: Weekend Warrior
```
Mon-Fri: OFF
Sat: 5 hours (9 AM - 2 PM)
Sun: 5 hours (9 AM - 2 PM)

Total: 10 hours/week
```

**Pros**: Deep focus blocks, no context switching
**Cons**: Easy to skip weekends, burnout risk

**My Recommendation**: Option A (weeknights + weekends)
- Consistency > intensity for part-time projects
- 2-hour blocks are manageable after work
- Weekend 4-hour block for complex features

---

## üí∞ Cost vs. Revenue Analysis

### Costs (Monthly)

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| AWS ECS Fargate | $2-5 | 0.25 vCPU, runs 1 hr/day |
| Supabase (DB) | $0 | Free tier sufficient for 100 users |
| AWS Amplify | $0 | Free tier: 1000 build mins/month |
| Domain | $1 | $12/year = $1/month |
| Stripe Fees | 2.9% + $0.30 | Per transaction (only on revenue) |

**Total Fixed Costs**: ~$3-6/month

### Revenue (Target: $1,000/month)

**Scenario: 35 Pro subscribers**
- Revenue: 35 √ó $29 = $1,015/month
- Stripe fees: $1,015 √ó 2.9% + ($0.30 √ó 35) = $40
- Fixed costs: $5/month
- **Net profit**: $970/month

**ROI**:
- 4 months √ó 10 hrs/week = 160 hours development
- $970/month profit
- Break-even: Month 1 after launch (immediate profit)
- Hourly rate: $970 / 10 hrs = **$97/hour** (after ramp-up)

---

## üéØ Critical Success Factors

To hit $1K MRR within 6 months of launch, you MUST:

### 1. Validate Product-Market Fit Early
**Action**: Get 5 users (friends/family) testing within Month 1
**Why**: Catch fatal flaws before building frontend
**How**:
- Manually add emails to daily digest
- Survey: "Would you pay $29/month for this?"
- Track open rates, click-throughs

### 2. Launch Imperfect
**Action**: Launch with minimal features after Month 3
**Why**: Real user feedback > theoretical planning
**How**:
- MVP = Login + Dashboard + Stripe checkout
- No charts, no API, no mobile app
- "This feature coming soon" is acceptable

### 3. Focus on One Acquisition Channel
**Action**: Pick ONE marketing channel, ignore the rest
**Why**: Part-time = limited marketing hours
**Options**:
- Reddit (free, high-intent audience)
- Twitter (build personal brand)
- SEO blog (long-term, compounding)
- Paid ads (expensive, requires testing)

**Recommendation**: Reddit + Twitter
- Post valuable content in r/StockMarket, r/algotrading
- Tweet daily top signal with screenshot
- DM active traders: "Hey, built this tool, want free access?"

### 4. Ruthlessly Cut Scope
**Action**: Defer any feature that doesn't drive conversions
**Why**: Part-time hours are precious
**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ Keep: Signal quality, dashboard, Stripe checkout
- ‚ùå Defer: API access, mobile app, social features, charts
- ‚ùå Defer: Advanced analytics, backtesting, portfolio tracking

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Decision Points

Before proceeding to next phase, evaluate:

### After Month 1 (Real Market Data)
**Question**: Are the signals actually useful?
**Test**: Show email to 5 traders, ask: "Would you follow these trades?"
- ‚úÖ If 3+ say yes ‚Üí Proceed to Month 2
- ‚ùå If < 3 say yes ‚Üí Fix signal quality before building frontend

### After Month 2 (Web Dashboard)
**Question**: Is the dashboard usable?
**Test**: Get 5 users to complete: signup ‚Üí view dashboard ‚Üí give feedback
- ‚úÖ If all 5 complete without major confusion ‚Üí Proceed to Month 3
- ‚ùå If users get stuck ‚Üí Improve UX before monetizing

### After Month 3 (MVP Launch)
**Question**: Are people willing to pay?
**Test**: Run 2-week free trial, then prompt for paid subscription
- ‚úÖ If ‚â• 10% convert ‚Üí Product-market fit confirmed, scale marketing
- ‚ùå If < 5% convert ‚Üí Fix value proposition before scaling

---

## üé® Design Simplicity Principle

**Part-time constraint = MUST use pre-built components**

### UI Library (Recommended)
**shadcn/ui** (https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Pre-built React components (buttons, cards, modals)
- Tailwind CSS based (easy to customize)
- Copy-paste components (no npm bloat)
- Free and open source

**Example**: Instead of building a custom pricing card from scratch (2 hours), use shadcn card component (15 minutes)

### Color Scheme
Keep it simple, use existing theme:
- Primary: #00ff88 (green, bullish)
- Danger: #ff4444 (red, bearish)
- Neutral: #8e8e93 (gray)
- Background: #1c1c1e (dark)
- Text: #ffffff (white)

Already defined in email CSS, reuse for frontend.

### Design Tools
- **Figma**: Skip it (too time-consuming)
- **Wireframes**: Use pen and paper (5 min)
- **Style guide**: Copy successful products (Robinhood, TradingView)

---

## üìä Metrics That Matter

### Pre-Launch (Months 1-3)
**Focus**: Development velocity
- ‚úÖ Hours coded per week (target: 10)
- ‚úÖ Features completed vs. planned
- ‚úÖ Bugs fixed vs. new bugs

### Post-Launch (Month 4+)
**Focus**: User acquisition and retention
- üéØ **Signups per week** (target: 10 in Month 4, 20 in Month 5, 30 in Month 6)
- üéØ **Free ‚Üí Pro conversion rate** (target: ‚â• 10%)
- üéØ **Monthly Recurring Revenue** (target: $1,000 by Month 6 post-launch)
- üéØ **Churn rate** (target: < 5% per month)
- üéØ **Email open rate** (target: > 40%)
- üéØ **Dashboard DAU** (target: 60% of paying users)

**Vanity Metrics** (ignore these):
- ‚ùå Total website visitors (doesn't predict revenue)
- ‚ùå Social media followers (doesn't drive conversions)
- ‚ùå Upvotes on Reddit posts (doesn't equal signups)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Justification

### Why These Choices?

**Backend: Python + FastAPI**
- ‚úÖ You already have this built
- ‚úÖ Fast to iterate (auto-reload in dev)
- ‚úÖ Great for data/ML work (yfinance, pandas)
- ‚ùå Alternative (Node.js) requires rewrite

**Frontend: React + TypeScript**
- ‚úÖ Industry standard (easy to hire help later)
- ‚úÖ Great ecosystem (shadcn/ui, React Query)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript catches bugs early
- ‚ùå Alternative (Vue) has smaller ecosystem

**Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)**
- ‚úÖ Free tier (500 MB, enough for MVP)
- ‚úÖ Hosted (no DevOps overhead)
- ‚úÖ Real-time subscriptions (if needed later)
- ‚ùå Alternative (MySQL) is less feature-rich

**Payments: Stripe**
- ‚úÖ Industry standard
- ‚úÖ Excellent docs
- ‚úÖ Test mode for development
- ‚ùå Alternative (PayPal) has worse UX

**Hosting: AWS ECS Fargate + Amplify**
- ‚úÖ Already set up and working
- ‚úÖ Cheap (~$5/month)
- ‚úÖ Scales if product grows
- ‚ùå Alternative (Heroku/Vercel) might be simpler but more expensive at scale

---

## üéØ The 80/20 Rule

**80% of revenue comes from 20% of features**

### The 20% (Build These First)
1. **Real market signals** - Core value proposition
2. **Email delivery** - Already done ‚úÖ
3. **Dashboard view** - Users want to see signals on-demand
4. **Stripe checkout** - Can't make money without this
5. **Custom watchlist** - Main reason to upgrade to Pro

### The 80% (Defer These)
- API access
- Mobile apps
- Advanced charts
- Backtesting
- Social features
- Performance analytics
- Real-time alerts
- SMS notifications
- Portfolio tracking
- News feed

Build these ONLY if users request them repeatedly.

## üìû When to Get Help

**Part-time development = can't afford to be stuck for days**

### Situations Where You Should Ask for Help (Claude, forums, contractors)

1. **Stuck on a bug for > 2 hours**
   - Don't waste 20% of your weekly hours on one issue
   - Post on StackOverflow, Reddit, or use Claude Code

2. **Technology you've never used before**
   - Example: Never used Stripe before? Copy their official example
   - Don't reinvent the wheel

3. **Design/UX decisions**
   - Show mockup to 3 friends: "Which layout is clearer?"
   - User feedback > your intuition

4. **Critical path blockers**
   - Example: Can't deploy to production
   - Pay a contractor $100 to unblock you (worth it)

### Situations Where You Should Figure It Out Yourself

1. **Minor CSS tweaks** - Use browser dev tools, iterate
2. **Code refactoring** - Works? Ship it. Refactor later if needed.
3. **Feature scope decisions** - Trust your roadmap, say no to scope creep
