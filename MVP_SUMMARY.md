# Market Intelligence Platform - MVP Summary

**Created**: October 14, 2025
**Your Goal**: Automated daily email with stock market intelligence

---

## What You Actually Need (The MVP)

You want a **simple automated system** that:
1. Runs every morning automatically
2. Analyzes market news and data
3. Sends you an email digest with trading insights
4. No web interface needed
5. No user signups needed
6. Just **you receiving daily market intelligence emails**

---

## What We Built (And Why)

We built a **full SaaS platform** with more features than you need:

### What You're Using (MVP):
- ‚úÖ **Backend API** - Market analysis engine
- ‚úÖ **Email Script** - Sends digest emails
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions** - Scheduled automation
- ‚úÖ **AWS ECS** - Runs the analysis daily
- ‚úÖ **Database** - Stores signals (optional for MVP)

### What You Don't Need Yet (But We Built):
- ‚ùå **Frontend Web App** - For users to sign up and view digests online
- ‚ùå **User Authentication** - Registration/login system
- ‚ùå **Multi-user Support** - Platform for many subscribers

**Why we built it**: The full platform lets you monetize this later (charge users for premium intelligence), but for MVP you just need the automated email.

---

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ LIVE in Production

**Backend API**: https://qwdhybryip.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com
- Status: LIVE and healthy
- Purpose: Powers the analysis engine
- Cost: ~$5-7/month

**Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- Status: Connected
- Purpose: Stores market signals
- Cost: $0/month (free tier)

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Partially Configured

**GitHub Actions Workflows**: Configured but not fully deployed
- Daily Digest (6:30 AM AZ): Ready to enable
- Scheduled Analysis (7:00 AM AZ): Ready to enable
- Missing: ECS Task Definition to run the scripts

### ‚ùå Not Deployed (Not Needed for MVP)

**Frontend Web App**: Ready to deploy but unnecessary for MVP
- You don't need users signing up yet
- You just want personal email digests
- Can deploy later when you want to monetize

---

## How It Works (MVP Flow)

```
GitHub Actions (Cron Schedule)
    ‚Üì
    Triggers daily at 6:30 AM Arizona Time
    ‚Üì
AWS ECS Fargate Task (Serverless Container)
    ‚Üì
    Runs: python send_daily_digest.py --email YOUR_EMAIL
    ‚Üì
Market Intelligence Engine
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Fetches market data (yfinance)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scrapes financial news (RSS feeds)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analyzes sentiment (VADER, TextBlob)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Identifies trading signals
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Generates insights
    ‚Üì
Email Service (SMTP)
    ‚Üì
    Sends beautiful HTML email to you
    ‚Üì
üìß YOU RECEIVE DAILY MARKET INTELLIGENCE
```

## What's Missing to Complete MVP

### 1. ECS Task Definition
**Status**: Cluster exists, but no task definition
**Purpose**: Tells AWS ECS how to run your analysis container
**Time**: 5 minutes to create

### 2. GitHub Secrets
**Status**: Need to configure
**Required Secrets**:
- `DIGEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` - Your email address
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Already configured
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Already configured

### 3. SMTP Configuration
**Status**: Need email credentials
**Options**:
- Gmail App Password (easiest)
- AWS SES (production-grade)
- SendGrid (alternative)

---

## Complete MVP Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Set Up SMTP Email (5 minutes)

**Option A: Gmail (Easiest)**
1. Go to Google Account ‚Üí Security
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Generate App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Save the 16-character password

**Option B: AWS SES (Production)**
```bash
aws ses verify-email-identity --email-address your@email.com
# Check email and click verification link
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets (2 minutes)

Go to: https://github.com/tuxninja/market-intel-platform/settings/secrets/actions

Add these secrets:
```
DIGEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL = your@email.com
SMTP_USERNAME = your-email@gmail.com (or AWS SES email)
SMTP_PASSWORD = your-app-password (16-char Gmail or AWS SES)
```

### Step 3: Create ECS Task Definition (Automated)

I'll create a script that sets this up automatically using your existing Docker image.

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Actions Schedule (1 minute)

Uncomment the schedule in `.github/workflows/daily-digest.yml`

### Step 5: Test It (Manual Trigger)

Run workflow manually to test before enabling daily schedule.

## MVP Costs

| Service | Cost | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **AWS App Runner** | $5-7/mo | API server (can remove for MVP) |
| **AWS ECS Fargate** | $0.50-1/mo | Runs daily digest (0.5 vCPU, 1 GB, 5 min/day) |
| **Supabase** | $0/mo | Database (free tier) |
| **AWS ECR** | $0.10/mo | Docker image storage |
| **Gmail SMTP** | $0/mo | Email delivery |
| **Total** | **~$6-8/mo** | Or ~$1-2/mo without App Runner |

**To Reduce Cost**: You don't actually need App Runner for MVP since you're just running scheduled tasks via ECS. We can shut it down and save $5-7/month.

---

## Two Deployment Paths

### Path 1: MVP Only (Recommended - $1-2/month)

**What You Get**:
- ‚úÖ Daily automated email digests
- ‚úÖ Market intelligence and trading signals
- ‚úÖ Runs on schedule via GitHub Actions + ECS
- ‚ùå No API server (don't need it)
- ‚ùå No web interface
- **Cost**: ~$1-2/month

**Steps**:
1. Create ECS task definition
2. Configure SMTP + GitHub secrets
3. Enable GitHub Actions schedule
4. Shut down App Runner (save $5-7/mo)

### Path 2: Full Platform ($6-8/month)

**What You Get**:
- ‚úÖ Everything from Path 1
- ‚úÖ Live API server for future features
- ‚úÖ Frontend ready to deploy when needed
- ‚úÖ Can add web interface later
- ‚úÖ Ready to monetize (add user signups)
- **Cost**: ~$6-8/month

**Steps**:
1. Create ECS task definition
2. Configure SMTP + GitHub secrets
3. Enable GitHub Actions schedule
4. Keep App Runner running
5. Deploy frontend when ready (optional)

---

## My Recommendation: Path 1 (MVP Only)

**Why**:
1. You just want daily emails for yourself
2. No need for API server or web interface yet
3. Saves $5-7/month
4. Can always add more features later
5. Faster to test and validate

**When to Switch to Path 2**:
- When you want to share with friends/colleagues
- When you're ready to monetize
- When you need a web interface
- When you have paying subscribers

---

## What Happens Next

I will:
1. ‚úÖ Create ECS task definition for your cluster
2. ‚úÖ Set up automated deployment script
3. ‚úÖ Document SMTP configuration steps
4. ‚úÖ Enable GitHub Actions scheduling
5. ‚úÖ Test end-to-end email delivery
6. ‚úÖ Give you simple commands to manage it

You will:
1. Provide SMTP credentials (Gmail or AWS SES)
2. Test receive your first digest email
3. Verify it looks good and has useful insights
4. Decide if you want to keep App Runner or shut it down
