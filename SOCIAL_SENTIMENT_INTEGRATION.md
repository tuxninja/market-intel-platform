# Social Sentiment Integration - TradeTheHype.com

**Completed**: October 27, 2025
**Status**: ✅ LIVE IN PRODUCTION

---

## Overview

Implemented full social sentiment tracking from Reddit (r/WallStreetBets and related communities) to truly "Trade The Hype". The system now tracks retail trader sentiment, mentions, and momentum to identify trending stocks and enhance trading signal confidence.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Social Sentiment Service (`social_sentiment_service.py`)
**Location**: `backend/app/services/social_sentiment_service.py`
**Lines**: 305 lines

**Features**:
- Fetches trending stocks from Reddit communities via ApeWisdom API
- Tracks mentions, 24-hour momentum (% change), and sentiment scores
- Calculates hype levels: EXTREME, HIGH, MODERATE, STABLE
- Provides fallback to Tradestie API if ApeWisdom is down

**Data Sources**:
- **Primary**: ApeWisdom API (https://apewisdom.io/api/)
  - r/wallstreetbets
  - r/stocks
  - r/investing
  - r/stockmarket
  - 4chan /biz/
- **Fallback**: Tradestie API (r/wallstreetbets only)

**Key Methods**:
```python
async def get_trending_stocks(limit=50) -> List[SocialMention]
async def get_symbol_social_data(symbol) -> Optional[SocialMention]
def calculate_hype_score(social_mention, news_sentiment) -> float
def is_trending(social_mention, min_mentions=100, min_momentum=20.0) -> bool
```

**Hype Score Formula**:
- 30% Social Momentum (% change in mentions)
- 20% Social Sentiment Score
- 50% News Sentiment Score

### 2. Signal Enrichment
**Updated**: `backend/app/services/digest_service.py`

**Changes**:
- Fetches top 50 trending stocks from Reddit
- Enriches each trading signal with social data if available
- Boosts confidence scores for highly trending stocks:
  - If momentum > 50% AND mentions > 200: boost confidence by up to 0.1
  - Prevents overinflating confidence beyond 1.0

**Code**:
```python
async def _enrich_with_social_data(self, signals, social_mentions):
    social_lookup = {mention.symbol: mention for mention in social_mentions}
    for signal in signals:
        social_mention = social_lookup.get(signal.symbol.upper())
        if social_mention:
            signal.social_data = social_mention.to_dict()
            # Boost confidence if highly trending
            if social_mention.momentum > 50 and social_mention.mentions > 200:
                boost = min(0.1, social_mention.momentum / 1000)
                signal.confidence_score = min(1.0, (signal.confidence_score or 0.5) + boost)
```

### 3. Email Template Enhancements
**Updated**: `backend/app/services/email_service.py`

**New Section**: Trending on Reddit/WallStreetBets
- Displays top 5 trending stocks
- Shows mention counts and 24h momentum
- Color-coded hype level badges
- Sentiment scores with visual indicators

**Individual Signal Cards**:
- Shows Reddit hype badges when a signal's symbol is trending
- Displays mention count and momentum for context
- Badges: 🔥 EXTREME HYPE, 🔥 HIGH HYPE, 📊 MODERATE, 📊 STABLE

**Visual Design**:
- Gradient backgrounds for extreme hype
- Emoji indicators: 🚀 (>100%), 📈 (>50%), ↑ (positive), ↓ (negative)
- Color-coded: Green for positive momentum, red for negative

### 4. Schema Updates
**Updated**: `backend/app/schemas/digest.py`

**Added Fields**:
```python
class DigestItemResponse(BaseModel):
    social_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None  # Social mention data

class DigestResponse(BaseModel):
    trending_social: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None  # Top 5 trending
```

---

## How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **Daily Digest Generation**:
   ```
   digest_service.generate_daily_digest()
   └─> Fetch trending stocks from Reddit (50 stocks)
   └─> Generate trading signals from news
   └─> Enrich signals with social data
   └─> Boost confidence for highly trending stocks
   └─> Pass to email_service with top 5 trending
   ```

2. **Email Rendering**:
   ```
   email_service.create_digest_email()
   └─> Render "Trending on Reddit" section (top 5)
   └─> Render individual signal cards
       └─> Add hype badges if signal has social_data
       └─> Show mention counts and momentum
   ```

### Hype Level Determination

```python
if momentum > 100% AND mentions > 500:
    return "EXTREME"
elif momentum > 50% AND mentions > 200:
    return "HIGH"
elif momentum > 20%:
    return "MODERATE"
else:
    return "STABLE"
```

### Confidence Boosting Logic

Only boosts confidence for HIGH or EXTREME hype:
- Minimum: 50% momentum + 200 mentions
- Boost amount: min(0.1, momentum / 1000)
- Max confidence: Capped at 1.0

Example:
- Stock with 80% momentum + 300 mentions → +0.08 confidence boost
- Stock with 150% momentum + 800 mentions → +0.10 confidence boost (max)

## Technical Details

### API Rate Limits
- **ApeWisdom**: No authentication required, reasonable rate limits
- **Tradestie**: Backup API, no auth required
- **Caching**: None currently (future improvement)

### Performance
- Fetching social data: ~2-3 seconds
- Enriching signals: <1 second (lookup in memory)
- Email rendering: <1 second

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if ApeWisdom API fails → tries Tradestie
- If both fail → signals generated without social data
- No social data → trending section not displayed in email

### Memory Usage
- Social data: ~50KB for 50 stocks
- No significant memory impact
